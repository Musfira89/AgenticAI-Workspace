Parallelization Workflow:

Fixed, predetermined structure
All tasks are known upfront and can run simultaneously
No dependencies between tasks
No central coordinator making decisions
Results are simply aggregated at the end

Example: Analyzing 5 different documents for sentiment

Task 1: Analyze doc1 → runs immediately
Task 2: Analyze doc2 → runs immediately
Task 3: Analyze doc3 → runs immediately
(all at once, then combine results)


Orchestrator Workflow:

Dynamic, adaptive structure
Central LLM decides what tasks to create as it goes
Tasks might run in parallel, sequence, or both
Orchestrator interprets results and plans next steps
Can create new tasks based on intermediate results

Example: Research a complex topic

Orchestrator: "I need to understand topic X"
Creates Task 1: Search for overview → Worker completes
Orchestrator reviews result: "I found 3 subtopics, need to investigate each"
Creates Tasks 2a, 2b, 2c in parallel → Workers complete
Orchestrator reviews: "2a needs deeper analysis"
Creates Task 3 based on 2a's findings
Synthesizes everything

The Core Difference
Parallelization = "Run these 5 predefined things at once, then merge"
Orchestrator = "Figure out what needs to be done, assign work, review results, decide what to do next
(which might include more parallel work)"
An orchestrator can use parallelization as one of its strategies, but it's fundamentally about dynamic 
planning and adaptation, not just concurrent execution.

or 
Key point: The chef (orchestrator) makes decisions step by step based on what they learn. 
They don't know the full plan from the beginning.

Simple Difference
Parallelization:

"Do A, B, and C at the same time" ✅ Already decided

Orchestrator:

"Let me see... do A first... okay based on A's result, now do B and C... hmm, now I need to do D..." 🤔 Deciding as you go

The orchestrator is like a smart manager who thinks and plans. Parallelization is just doing multiple things at once.



Syntax:
prompt = f"""

Purpose:
Creates a dynamic prompt that summarizes:

The user query
What analysis steps are already completed
Asks the LLM to decide the next action

Syntax
f""" ... """

f → enables string interpolation
Triple quotes → multiline string
